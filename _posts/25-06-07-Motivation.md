One challenge I want to solve with technology is securing the software that powers so much of our digital world. From the apps on our phones to school platforms, hospitals, and government systems, this software is used daily by people everywhere. But because many of these projects lack proper security support, they become easy targets — leaving millions vulnerable to data breaches, malware, and cyberattacks. I want to help protect everyday users and make sure the technology we all depend on stays trustworthy, safe, and secure.  

I want the first two people I tell about my success to be my mom and dad together because they’ve always been in my corner. They’ve seen me at my highest and my lowest, and through it all, they never stopped believing in me. Telling them first just feels right because it’s my way of saying, we did it, because I wouldn’t be where I am without their love, support, and encouragement.  

Two open source projects I’m really interested in contributing to are OpenSSF [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) and [Allstar](https://github.com/ossf/allstar). Scorecard helps check the health of open source projects by looking at things like how secure their code is, how well they manage dependencies, and whether they follow good practices. Allstar takes that a step further by actually enforcing those security rules on GitHub, so projects stay protected automatically. I like that both tools focus on making open source safer for everyone, and they’re beginner-friendly, which is perfect for where I am in my journey. Even though I’m still growing my technical skills, especially in coding, these projects offer ways to contribute through testing, documentation, and helping improve security workflows.
