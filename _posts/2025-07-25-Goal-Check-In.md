As I wrap up the in-person portion of my internship contributing to open source projects, I’ve taken some time to reflect on how far I’ve come. In my very first blog post, 
"My Journey Begins!", I shared my initial experience with open source and the technical skills I brought to the table. Since then, I believe I’ve grown significantly—both technically 
and professionally.  

One area of progress I’ve noticed is my growing confidence in my skills. While I know I still have a lot to learn, I’ve started to take more initiative and challenge myself—something
that marks a big improvement from where I began. I’ve also become more comfortable relying on others. I’ve always been someone who offers help and steps up as a leader, but now I’m 
learning the value of being truly collaborative and communicative.  

Becoming more open to collaboration and communication is just the beginning of my growth in confidence. I’ve also made strides in my technical confidence. Asking questions and 
receiving hands-on support has helped me build a stronger foundation in the open source space. I believe that continuing to take initiative and embracing new challenges will further 
develop both my technical abilities and my confidence in this field.

The support that Emily, Silas, and Samir have given me has been truly amazing. Their guidance, encouragement, and willingness to help have made a huge difference in my growth 
throughout this journey. Honestly, if they continue to push me, challenge me, and guide me in the right direction, I have no doubt that I’ll continue to make meaningful progress
and keep improving both personally and technically.
