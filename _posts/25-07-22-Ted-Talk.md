I thought Abby’s talk definitely aligned with my experience in open source so far. Getting started can be hard, especially because there’s not much one-on-one guidance. While documentation is helpful, it doesn’t always answer the questions beginners have, and without someone to guide you, it’s easy to feel stuck.
I’ve also noticed that many open source communities are already well-established. Joining a new project can feel intimidating, and trying to fit into multiple communities at once can be overwhelming. It can be hard to feel like you belong or know where to start.
Abby’s points about making open source more welcoming and supportive really stood out to me.  

In the beginning, I spent a lot of time trying to understand how open source works, why it’s useful, and where I should even begin. I kept asking myself: What should I be looking out for? What kinds of projects align with my goals? Who can I turn to for advice and guidance? And once I choose a project—where do I actually start?  

As a newcomer, it felt like everything was already established, like the community had its own way of doing things, and I was just an outsider looking in. The last thing I wanted to do was give the wrong input or accidentally upset the community. Without a clear path or someone to guide me, I found myself second-guessing every step. Abby’s talk really helped me realize that I wasn’t alone in feeling that way—and that these challenges are more common than they seem, especially with most of the new contributors being gen z. 

We need open source spaces where people feel included, not only that they have access. The existence of a public GitHub repository does not guarantee it is an open environment. People, and especially newcomers, are less likely to engage in a closed-off and intimidating atmosphere. Acknowledgment is also a big deal. Gen Z largely attempts to engage with a purpose, identity, and community, and in our case, it is crucial that we engage in a purpose that is not limited to coding. Visibility is another problem—many people, especially students, do not participate because they have no idea where to begin or do not realize that open source has roles beyond software development. Documenting, interface design, social content management, or even qualitative testing are in the domain of non-code skills, and supporting these non-code roles has the potential to enable far greater participation in ways that are aligned with people’s skills and passions.

I think some ways to draw in my Gen Z peers would be to create more beginner-friendly cohorts and learning opportunities. Clear, simple walkthroughs and well-written documentation on GitHub would make it easier to get involved. It’s also important that contributors are properly credited for their work, whether it’s code or non-code contributions.

Mentorship, shoutouts, and community spaces like Discord for asking questions can make open source feel more welcoming. Gen Z wants to feel connected and valued, and with the right support, I think more of us would be excited to contribute.
