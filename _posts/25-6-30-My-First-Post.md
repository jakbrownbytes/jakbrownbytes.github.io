Hello and welcome to my first blog post!✨ My name is Jakiya Brown and I am a rising junior computer science major with a concentration in cybersecurity at Norfolk State University. I'm originally from the 757 area in Virginia, and I'm passionate about technology,👩‍💻 digital security, and using my skills to make a positive impact❣. Through this blog, I’ll be sharing my journey, experiences, and insights as I continue to grow in the tech world. I'm excited to connect, learn, and document everything along the way!🌠    

As I don't have any hands-on experience with open source before now, I have been somewhat familiar with the concept of open source and different ways it can be used. For example, I devote time for my own self-studies📓 in open source doing [OSINT](https://youtu.be/qwA6MmbeGNo?si=x2sZ76nNbwL-P_k1). This stands for open source intelligence, which is used to gather publicly available information from the internet and other open platforms to analyze patterns, behaviors, and threats. It's a skill that blends research and critical thinking💭, and it's helped me understand how valuable open data can be when applied responsibly and effectively.  

I know that my strongest🦾 skill or characteristic is having initiative with a collaborative mindset. I’m someone who takes the lead on learning new things, exploring different tools, and finding ways to grow—but I also value working alongside others, sharing knowledge, and supporting the team☀. Whether it's contributing to open source, mentoring peers, or jumping into group projects, I enjoy creating spaces where everyone can succeed together.  

Even though I have that strong skill, I still want to improve my confidence in the tech field. There are times when I second guess myself or hesitate to speak up, especially in spaces that feel more advanced or fast paced. But I know that confidence comes with practice, exposure, and trusting my abilities. That’s why I’ve been pushing myself to get more involved, whether it’s through open source, internships, or personal projects, so I can keep growing🌐, learning, and showing up as my best self in tech.🫶
