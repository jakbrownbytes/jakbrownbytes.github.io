Yesterday I got to opportunity to take a day trip to San Francisco and Oakland, where I got to visit the tech company GitHub! This is an amazing and inspiring visit for many reasons:  
- I got to see first hand how the company operates and the different departmetsn that are within the company.  
- I loved how the company was set up and how they utilized the creative side of technology to make their work environment more welcoming and friendly for those who enter.  
- Special thank you to PJ Metz for such an amazing presentation as well. I believe that the concept of being confused is a must to truly understanding to the fullest potential. It is a special part of learning that is taken as a sign of negativity, but in reality we need this feeling to progress and grow as individuals. Being confused is not a sign of failure, it should be a sign to push forward and work hard for your goals.

I also got to experience the Forte Pointe Black Gold Exhibit. I think this was an experience that was eye opening.

Lastly, I had a wonderful meal at Brenda's in Oakland California with my cohort.   

This experience with the Contributor Catalyst Program was definitely a great way to get insight and network and I thank them fully for the amazing opportunity.
