Hello Everyone! I am a junior computer science major with a concentration in cybersecurity, attending Norfolk State University. Right now I am interning for UCSC Open Source Contributor Catalyst Program.  

### More Information

I've created this blog to share my skills, knowledge, and learnings from the summer program. This space allows me to document my growth, showcase the projects I work on, and reflect on my journey in real time. I aim to continue sharing my experiences and talents here even after the program ends, as I grow further in tech and beyond.  

If you would like to know more about me, please locate "My First Blog" on my blog page.
